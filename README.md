## next steps

Currently, this project operates only locally as a “script”. However, I have ambitious plans for the future of Create-Web-CLI:

Publication: I plan to publish this project to package managers in the JavaScript ecosystem (pnpm, npm, yarn, bun…). This will make it easier for other developers to install and use Create-Web-CLI.
Live-Preview: I’m considering adding a live-preview feature - a compact server that is generated for development and provides automatic page reloading. This would eliminate the need for a third-party/external extension and enhance the development experience.
Bundler: Ultimately, I want to transform Create-Web-CLI into a full-fledged bundler. This would provide a comprehensive solution for setting up and managing web projects.

#### Why I Created This Project
I was already familiar with several open-source initiatives that automated the generation of bundlers/projects. However, none of them offered what I was seeking: a simple setup with just HTML, CSS, and JS. So, I used this as a pretext to delve deeper into the Node runtime environment and gain a better understanding of executing Javascript. This project serves not only as a tool to assist others in setting up their web projects but also as a learning journey for me. Through the process of building Create-Web-CLI, I’ve gained a more profound understanding of Javascript and the Node environment. I hope this tool can simplify your project setup process and inspire you to learn more and create your own tools. Happy coding!
